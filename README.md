# CameronLewisAppliedProject
A usability study assessing the value of web accessibility guidelines such as Section 508 and WCAG

## Todo:
1. Add Data Visualization examples and find accessibility best practices
2. Add more basic styles throughout the site pending Usability and Color Metrology courses this fall
3. Add more use of color to assess color contrast requirements
4. Explore adding more content types to increase coverage (i.e. image gallery, accordion, progress bar)
